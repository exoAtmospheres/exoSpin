Installation
============

The installation of the package is done through ``PyPI``. 


Create a conda environment
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It's recommended to create a Python environment, but you don't have to. However you need to make sure taht your Python version is ``3.11``.
We will create a ``conda`` environment. You can `learn more about conda here <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_ .

You can create your environment as:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda create -n env_exospin python=3.11
    $ conda activate env_exospin

You need to make sure that the Python version is ``3.11``.


Installation through PyPI
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

PyPI is the `pip package manager <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/>`_, which will install the package and all other the requiered dependencies in your Python environment.

To install the latest version of exoSpin, run :

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install exoSpin
